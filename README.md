# W1CK3D Smart Shopper

W1CK3D Smart Shopper is a Python script that allows users to calculate the total cost of their shopping items, including sales tax. Simply input the product details and quantities, and the Smart Shopper will handle the rest.

## Usage

```bash
python smart_shopper.py
Follow the prompts to enter product names, descriptions, prices, and quantities. Type 'done' to finish entering products. The script will then calculate the total cost, add sales tax, and generate a detailed receipt.

Example
bash
Copy code
Customer Receipt:
Product1: Description1 - $10.00 x 2
Product2: Description2 - $20.00 x 1
Total Cost: $40.00
Sales Tax (8.8%): $3.52
Final Total: $43.52
Note: This script assumes a fixed sales tax rate of 8.8%. You can modify the script to change the tax rate if needed.
