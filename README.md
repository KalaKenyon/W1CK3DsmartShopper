# W1CK3D Smart Shopper

W1CK3D Smart Shopper is a Python script that simplifies the task of calculating the total cost of shopping items, including sales tax. Users can input product details and quantities, and the Smart Shopper will handle the rest, generating a detailed receipt.

NOTE: This was created from the "ReceiptsforLovelyLoveseats" portion of CodeAcademy learning but was altered to be used by anyone with any information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `W1CK3D_Smart_Shopper.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python:
   `python W1CK3D_Smart_Shopper.py`
3. Follow the prompts to enter product names, descriptions, prices, and quantities. Type `'done'` to finish entering products. The script will calculate the total cost, add sales tax, and generate a detailed receipt.

## Example

Customer Receipt:
Product1: Description1 - $10.00 x 2
Product2: Description2 - $20.00 x 1
Total Cost: $40.00
Sales Tax (8.8%): $3.52
Final Total: $43.52

**Note:** This script assumes a fixed sales tax rate of 8.8%. You can modify the script to change the tax rate if needed.
